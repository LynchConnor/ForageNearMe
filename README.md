# ForageNearMe
## Introduction
### Problem Domain
- Limited apps assisting foragers track local foraging spots.
- Existing apps are old fashioned and do not have a modern design.
- Limited dedicated forums to discuss local foraging.

### Solution
- Create an app which helps foragers track and manage foraging spots around them, with a clean and easy to use interface.
- Develop a forum for local foragers to interact with eachother, sharing tips and tricks.

### Existing Products
#### iNaturalist
- iNaturalist allows users to create an account and mark on a map a plant/foraging spot they've discovered, allowing all users to visit and view the spot.
- By discussing this on a foraging forum, I found that this can be problematic as it can provoke reckless individuals destroying greenland.
- Individuals on this forum also identified that they preferred a private account where they could mark a foraging spot on a map and only they can see it.
- This would be beneficial as greenland doesn't get destroyed and the forager can keep track of all their foraging spots.
